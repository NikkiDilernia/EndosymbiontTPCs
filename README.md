# EndosymbiontTPCs
TPC Application to cultured Endosymbionts
This GitHub Repository has been created to deposit code and data as used in a recent TPC study contrasting the thermal performance of cultured coral endosymbiont photo-physiology. Including algorithm evaluation and reporting selection criteria for best model choice, in conjunction with depositing data from TPC studies, will allow for reprocessing at any time using different models for comparison to optimise results. 
All statistical analyses for these TPCs were carried out in RStudio Teams version 2022.07.02 (Build 576), with additional modelling packages “nls.multstart” and “rTPC” integrated by Padfield et al. (2021).
